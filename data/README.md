# Data Directory

This repository contains annotation and preprocessed data for our project. The following directories are included:

- brat_v1: This is the current version of the raw annotation files formatted in BRAT style. These annotations are the primary set used in our studies.
- brat_v2: This directory includes the results of entity normalization, along with all annotations from v1. This version is an experimental set that will be updated in future studies as we refine the normalization process.
- DiMB-RE: This directory contains the preprocessed data for span-based Named Entity Recognition (NER), specifically formatted for use with the DiMB-RE framework.
